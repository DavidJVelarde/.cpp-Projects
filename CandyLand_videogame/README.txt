ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This project is an in-teriminal version of the game Candy Land. The goal of the game is for players to eventually reach the castle, at the end of the board. 
My project is meant to be played with 1 or 2 players.Both players move on the board, and board is displayed, and players can visit candy stores
to buy more candies.
